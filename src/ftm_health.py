"""Daily coverage audit and health digest for the first-to-market pull.

Answers one question every morning: is all of our FTM data actually being pulled,
and if not, which feed stopped. Posts one message a day, green or red, so silence
is never the signal.

    python src/ftm_health.py                 # the two-line daily summary
    python src/ftm_health.py --full          # the detailed report, on demand
    python src/ftm_health.py --days 14       # wider history window
    python src/ftm_health.py --post          # print and post to Slack
    python src/ftm_health.py --check         # one line, exit 1 if red (watchdog)
    python src/ftm_health.py --selftest      # assertions, no network, no writes

WHAT GETS SAID IS NOT WHAT GETS CHECKED. The daily post is deliberately two lines
(new records per DataSift list) plus one reason line when something is wrong. Every
check below still runs on every pass; a green day just has nothing worth saying.
The detailed version is `--full`.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `ftm_runner._notify` fires only when a run COMPLETES. If the
machine stops or the scheduler dies, nothing is emitted at all, and a dead box
looks exactly like a quiet day. Worse, the runner reports the notices stage as one
aggregate number, so a run where both probate feeds silently returned nothing
still reads as healthy: 2026-08-28 uploaded 19 records and every one was
foreclosure. Per-feed is the only altitude at which "is everything being pulled"
is answerable.

THREE COUNTING RULES, each learned from real data on this volume:

1. UPLOADED IS NOT NEW. `POST /property/` is upsert by address, and the county
   stage re-uploads the same 10 condemnation rows every single day (verified: the
   address column of knox_ftm_pull_*.csv hashes identically across 08-22, 08-25
   and 08-28). A "new records" figure built on the uploaded count would report 10
   fresh leads a day forever. New is measured against a persisted address ledger.

2. A ZERO DAY IS NOT A DEAD FEED. Each saved search publishes in bursts: Knox
   probate landed on 08-24 and 08-25 and nothing either side. Alerting on a single
   quiet day would cry wolf daily. The metric is DAYS SINCE the feed last produced
   a record, against FTM_FEED_STALE_DAYS.

3. A SKIPPED STAGE IS NOT A HEALTHY STAGE. `StageResult.ok` counts "skipped" as
   OK, so if the county stage reverts to skipping (it needs the SiftMap client) the
   run still exits 0 and Slack still shows green. The audit treats a stage that
   `FTM_ARGS` asked for and did not get as a finding. Deliberately checked here
   rather than by changing the runner's exit contract, which the scheduler rides on.

Config:
  FTM_HEALTH_WEBHOOK    Slack incoming webhook; falls back to SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
  FTM_FEED_STALE_DAYS   per-feed staleness threshold (default 7)
  FTM_HEALTH_WINDOW     default history window in days (default 14)
