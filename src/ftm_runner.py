"""Unattended first-to-market run: scrape -> enrich -> CSV -> DataSift -> Slack.

This is the single entry point the scheduler calls. Everything it needs comes
from environment variables, it writes its state to a directory that can live on
a mounted volume, and it exits non-zero on any outcome that a human needs to
look at.

    python src/ftm_runner.py                      # dry run, nothing written
    python src/ftm_runner.py --commit             # the real thing
    python src/ftm_runner.py --stages notices     # one stage only
    python src/ftm_runner.py --doctor             # wiring check, no scraping

WHY A SEPARATE RUNNER instead of `main.py daily --upload-datasift`:

  * The upload path in main.py drives the DataSift web UI with Playwright.
    That is fine when a human is watching a browser and hopeless at 4am: the
    wizard changes, a modal steals focus, and the run hangs instead of failing.
    This runner pushes over the API (datasift_api_upload), which returns counts.
  * A scheduled run has to be loud about doing nothing. Every stage here
    reports a status, and "0 notices" is a FAILURE, not a quiet success. The
    scrape sat dead for 19 days in July 2026 while every run reported success.
  * The scheduler needs one exit code for the whole chain.

EXIT CODES
  0  everything that ran, worked
  1  a stage failed (details in the summary and in Slack)
  2  misconfiguration caught before any work started (doctor-style failure)
  3  the run was blocked by egress (the site refuses this IP), actionable and
     distinct, because no amount of retrying fixes it
