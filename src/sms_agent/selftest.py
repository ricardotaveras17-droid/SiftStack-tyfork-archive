"""Offline end-to-end exercise of every phase. Sends nothing, writes nothing.

Runs against a throwaway database with the network stubbed out, so it is safe
to run any time, on any machine, with production credentials loaded. It asserts
behaviour rather than printing it, because the failure this guards against is
the one this codebase keeps rediscovering: a run that reports success while
doing nothing.
