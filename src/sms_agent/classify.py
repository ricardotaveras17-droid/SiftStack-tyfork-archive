"""Reply classification.

Deterministic rules run FIRST and are final for the two buckets that carry
legal or data consequences. An LLM must never be the thing that decides
whether somebody opted out.

Ported from the proven `_api/mms_responses.py` classifier with one change that
matters for a conversational agent: OPT_OUT and NOT_INTERESTED are separate.
The batch classifier lumped "not interested" into opt-out, which is correct
when you only ever suppress, and wrong here: a soft no is a conversation a
closer handles, a legal opt-out is one you must honor and never text again.

Return exactly one intent:
- INTERESTED: engages about selling, asks price/offer/process, asks to be called, says yes, or gives any opening.
- NOT_INTERESTED: a soft no. Not selling, already listed, has an agent, "no thanks". This is NOT a legal opt-out.
- WRONG_NUMBER: says they are not the owner, do not own the property, or the number belongs to someone else.
- ASKING_WHO: does not know who is texting or how you got their info, asks what property, or asks if this is a bot or a scam.
- ESCALATE: mentions a lawyer, a death, bankruptcy, harassment, a regulator, or anything a human must handle personally.
- OTHER: anything that fits none of the above.

Rules:
- Judge only this message in the context of the thread. Do not infer motivation that is not there.
- The first text asks whether an address belongs to them. So "yes", "it is", "correct", "that's mine" answer the OWNERSHIP question. Confirming ownership is not a signal about selling, and on its own it is OTHER, never INTERESTED.
- When a reply confirms ownership AND says anything about keeping the house ("it is, and it's staying that way", "yes, but I'm not selling", "that's mine and I plan to keep it"), the second half is the answer. Label it NOT_INTERESTED. The confirmation only tells you the phone number is right.
- INTERESTED needs a signal about SELLING: a price question, an opening, a request to be called, a reason they might move. Attachment to the house is the opposite of that signal.
- If the message could plausibly be two intents, pick the more conservative one (ESCALATE over INTERESTED, ASKING_WHO over INTERESTED, NOT_INTERESTED over INTERESTED) and lower your confidence.
- confidence is your honest probability that a careful human would assign the same label. Do not inflate it.
- Never label a message OPT_OUT. Opt-outs are decided before you see the message."""
