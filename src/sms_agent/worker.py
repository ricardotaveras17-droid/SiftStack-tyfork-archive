"""Worker: drains the event log, then drains the outbox.

Two loops, deliberately separate:

  * Event processing turns a stored webhook into CRM writes / escalations /
    drafts. Slow (LLM + CRM round trips) but never blocks the receiver.
  * Outbox draining is the ONLY place a message is actually sent. Quiet hours,
    per-number caps, pacing, and suppression are all enforced here, so there is
    exactly one code path that can put a text on a stranger's phone.

    python src/sms_agent/cli.py work            # one pass
    python src/sms_agent/cli.py work --loop     # continuous
