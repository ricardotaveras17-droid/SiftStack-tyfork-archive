"""The brain: turn a webhook into CRM writes, an escalation, and maybe a reply.

Autonomy ladder (SMS_AGENT_PHASE):
  1  classify inbound and write phone status / opt-outs. No replies, no Slack.
  2  + escalate positive replies to the prospector channel and flip the CRM.
  3  + draft replies, held for approval in Slack. Still nothing auto-sent.
  4  + auto-send the highest-confidence intents only; everything else drafts.

The ladder exists because the phone number is the asset. Phase 2 already gives

    sends the same four touch templates from the inbox, so a rep's text read as

    Calibrated against 2,198 real outbound events on 2026-08-28 rather than

      * Our own sends arrive as source='api' with an empty userName, and 583 of

    into a conversation that has replies is a human stepping in, while a first
