"""Cross-cutting utilities for the deep_prospecting module.

Lives outside `phases/` and `sources/` so any layer can import without
creating cycles. Keep this module DEPENDENCY-LIGHT — stdlib + this
module's own models only. Anything heavier (Anthropic, Playwright) goes
in `llm.py` or specific source modules.

  - Cost ceiling constants (the ceiling/target for the orchestrator).
  - `_safe()` — coroutine wrapper with retry/backoff/logging.
  - `slug()` — filesystem-safe identifier from an address/owner string.

# Hard ceiling: orchestrator stamps abort + halts before a phase whose
# projected spend would push total over this.
#
# Slice 1 placeholder was $0.18 (CBC-only, no paid APIs). Slice 2 raised
# to $1.00 because Tracerfy at $0.10/heir × 3 heirs + Trestle at $0.015
# × ~10 phones lands an L3 case near $0.50 with headroom for outliers.

# Target: aspirational — runs above this aren't aborted, but the orchestrator
# can use it to choose cheaper variants (e.g., Haiku vs Sonnet for the
# DM-reasoning paragraph) when below target, switch to faster/cheaper
# strategies when above. Slice 2: $0.50 target per spec.
