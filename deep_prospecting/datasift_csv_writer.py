"""Round-trip-safe CSV writer for DataSift exports.

DataSift's CSV export has a 229-column fixed schema (validated against
test_data/sample_export.csv). This writer:

  1. Reads a DataSift CSV preserving every column and value.
  2. Overlays deep-prospecting results onto matched rows:
       - new phones into the next-empty Phone N slot
       - new emails into the next-empty Email N slot
       - tags appended to the row's Tags column
       - markdown research-pack block written to Notes
         (column injected if missing — required for the operator
          workflow even though the export shape may omit it)
  3. Writes the CSV back preserving column order + non-touched cells.

Round-trip contract: read CSV → write CSV with no overlay → output ==
input (byte-for-byte except for the trailing newline / line endings,
which we normalize to Unix `\\n`). Validated by `validate_round_trip()`.

Phone slot rules:
  - Per-row scan from Phone 1 → Phone 30; first empty slot is the write
    point for our highest-confidence new phone.
  - Never overwrite an existing phone (operator-verified data is sacred).
  - If all 30 slots are full, we drop the lowest-confidence new phones
    to fit and append `Deep Prospect Phones Truncated` to the row's Tags.

Phone Tag format (deterministic order):
    {SubjectRole},{stars},{Source Flag}

Examples:
    Subject,*,Verified 2+ Sites
    Heir,**,Found via TPS
    Family Pivot,***,Found via CBC

Dial First/Second/Third labels are intentionally NOT emitted here —
those come from Trestle phone-scoring downstream of the CLI, which has
the line-type + carrier reputation data needed to rank dial priority.
