"""Skill packaging: source trees in, distributable ZIPs out.

The unit of truth is the SOURCE TREE at skills/<name>/ and plugins/<name>/.
The .skill and .plugin files under dist/ are build products, regenerated from
source. That direction matters: a ZIP is opaque to git, so a skill that only
ever existed as a ZIP could not be diffed, reviewed, or fixed by anyone but
the person holding the original folder. Fifteen months of skill edits are
invisible in this repo's history for exactly that reason.

    python tools/build_skills.py --unpack     # ZIPs -> source trees (migration)
    python tools/build_skills.py --build      # source trees -> dist/*.skill
    python tools/build_skills.py --manifest   # regenerate skills/manifest.json
    python tools/build_skills.py --verify     # dist matches source? (CI gate)

--unpack is a ONE-TIME migration and is destructive to the source trees it
writes. Everything else is safe to re-run.

Stdlib only, on purpose: this runs in CI, on a community member's laptop, and
inside a Co-Work session, and none of those are guaranteed to have pip.
